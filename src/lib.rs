//! Functions to find the difference between two texts (strings).
//!
//! Usage
//! ----------
//!
//! Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! difference = "2.0"
//! ```
//!
//! Now you can use the crate in your code
//!
//! ```ignore
//! extern crate difference;
//! ```
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! See [Examples.md](Examples.md) for more examples.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use difference::{Difference, Changeset};
//!
//! let changeset = Changeset::new("test", "tent", "");
//!
//! assert_eq!(changeset.diffs, vec![
//!   Difference::Same("te".to_string()),
//!   Difference::Rem("s".to_string()),
//!   Difference::Add("n".to_string()),
//!   Difference::Same("t".to_string())
//! ]);
//! ```
